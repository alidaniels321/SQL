# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

##What is the average danceability, popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
Select 
artist_name, 
track_name, 
avg(danceability), 
avg(popularity),
avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name, track_name


##Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
Select artist_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by popularity desc limit 10

##What artist released the longest song? 
Select artist_name, max(duration_ms)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata

##What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
Select track_name, avg(danceability)as Average_Danceability
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Where track_name in 
    (Select track_name
    from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    Order by popularity desc limit 10)
Group by track_name

--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
